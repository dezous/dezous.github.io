              Your card details are entered on a special secure payment page.

              If your card supports 3D Secure technology, in order to make a
              payment, you will need to go through additional user verification
              at the issuing bank (the bank that issued your card). To do this,
              you will be directed to the page of the bank that issued the card.
              The type of check depends on the bank. As a rule, this is an
              additional password that is sent by SMS, a card of variable codes,
              or other methods.
